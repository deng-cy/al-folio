Welcome to my personal website!

I am currently a PhD student at [University of Michigan, Ann Arbor](https://umich.edu/). I am in [Mechanical Engineering](https://me.engin.umich.edu/) and focus on modeling and design of rechargable batteries. Download my [**CV**](assets/pdf/resume.pdf).


This website gives a brief introduction to me. I started to work on it in 2020/09. Now it includes [education](#education), [news](#education), [publications](/publications/index.html), [projects](/projects/index.html). I will add more information in the future.  

Please do not hesitate to contact me for any question, comment or complaint. I am working on various types of projects from coding to experiments, and have multiple hobbies such as video games, Go game, swmimming, and table tennis. So you are welcome to discuss any fun stuff with me :smiley:

## Research interests 
	
  I am working on modeling and design of rechargable batteries. Specifically, my research includes the following three categories. See [projects](/projects/index.html) for recent research projects. 

### Cell-level modeling and parameterization of Li-ion batteries

* Building psuedo two-dimensional (P2D) model with degradation mechanisms. 
* Conducting experiments and regression to figure out the parameters used in the models. [[more](/projects/parameter)]
* Investigating techniques to improve measurement acuracy. [[more](/projects/gitteis)]

  GITT and EIS are two popular techniques to measure diffusivity. Yet, their results sometimes have up to orders of magnitude difference. This project resolved their discrepancy of diffusivity measurement. Click on the figure to read more. 
</div>

### Battery-related optimization algorithms


* Background: both simulation and experiment in battery field are time-consuming, and it will be more problematic to optimize battery parameters and morphology. 
* Trying to design gradient-free algorithms to reduce the number of trials (configurations).  [[more](/projects/solo)]

  We tried to optimize the mophology of electrode for lithium ion batteries without any prior assumption on its pattern. We devised a gradient-free algoritm to solve such a problem and obtained a branch-like pattern. Click on the figure to read more. 
</div>

* Considering the time-dependent nature of battery cycling will be considered. 

	
### Battery material design 

* Manufacturing materials based on the output of optimization. [[more](/projects/pcx)]

  We used a carbon template to make anode for batteries. As our preliminary result, we came up with a extremely cheep phosphorus/carbon anode material for sodium-ion batteries. Click on the figure to read more.
